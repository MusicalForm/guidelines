This website is being generated using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites).
As of now, the source is is simply the annotation-pilot wiki embedded as a submodule. This is why this repo needs to be cloned recursively: `git clone --recursive git@github.com:MusicalForm/guidelines.git`.

When you have [Quarto installed](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) you can render the homepage via `quarto render`. To preview, do `quarto preview`. The preview in your browser will update once you save changes to any of the source files.
