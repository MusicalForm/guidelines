# LCMA Form Annotation Standard Specification

This document specifies how annotation labels need to be structure in order to conform to the syntax devised 
at the Linz Computational Music Analysis (LCMA) group. The syntax is being encoded in Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF)
and [visualised](index.md) using railroad diagrams generated on https://www.bottlecaps.de/rr/ui .
The grammar is contained in the file [lcma_standard.ebnf](lcma_standard.ebnf) in this directory.
