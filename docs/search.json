    "text": "Although there is no universally shared understanding of musical form, we wish to propose a working definition that contains typical components of form:\n\nSegmentation: The auditory stream of events is usually subdivided (or grouped) into larger chunks of events. Segmentation may be based on a variety of factors such as gestalt principles or closing patterns such as cadences. Furthermore, adjacent groups may be disjunct or conjunct (phrase overlap).\nHierarchy: Groups of events can be summarized into ever larger groups, thus creating hierarchical relationships between them.\nFunctionality: Groups do not only occur at a certain position within the overall structure, but can also express their form-functionality (i.e., their temporal qualities) through their intrinsic features. They may project a sense of beginning, middle, or end at different hierarchical levels.\nSimilarity: Groups may be repetitions or variations of other groups, or they express a contrast to other groups.\nFormal templates: the ordering of groups as well as the functionalities they express may be such that typical patterns emerge which we refer to as formal templates (e.g., minuet form, rondo form, sonata form, etc.). Formal designs may be the result of the combination of two (or more) formal types (e.g., a theme combining elements from a “sentence” and a “period”); this is known as hybrid form.\n\nReinterpretation"

    "text": "In TiLiA, each element in a hierarchy timeline can be given a label. The use of labels should follow a syntax, which extends that of Gotham and Ireland (2019) in several important ways:\n\nIn annotation via MuseScore, a typical first label of a sonata form movement can look like this:\n\n0: mvt1|sonata.type1, 1: exp, 2: 1st zone, 3: 1st|sent, 4: pres, 5: bi\nWhen Using TiLiA, the position within the hierarchical structure no longer has to be specified by an integer, since it is captured within the hierarchy timeline.\n\nIt is possible to clarify the formal types (e.g., the type of sonata) used to realise a particular formal function (such as a first movement, or exposition) by using the pipe symbol (|). In the case above, in level 0 we are dealing with a so-called type 1 sonata-form movement (Hepokoski & Darcy, 2006b), whereas the 1st theme (level 3) is realised as a Caplinian sentence.\nWe include a higher level 0 that accounts for the whole movement–—or work—, in this case the 1st movement of a piece. Therefore, we suggest using this level 0 to indicate the position of the piece (or movement) in its context and the overall form type(s) which function(s) as the root of the overarching form tree.\nFor easier annotation, we have implemented a series of abbreviations for the most frequent terms in formal analysis (see Table A1 in the Supplementary materials). When extracted and converted into a tree-like representation, all tokens that correspond to a standardised (and custom) abbreviation are spelled out.\nFormal functions and types: Our standard distinguishes between formal functions and types (Caplin, 1998). For both, the categories and abbreviations listed in Table A1 can be used. Formal subtypes, such as the five types of sonata form as proposed by sonata theory, appear after the corresponding formal (super)type separated by a dot, usually on levels 0 or 1. Realisations of formal functions, such as periods and sentences, are appended to the relevant token using a pipe symbol (|). Label 2 above makes use of both syntactical elements with the label component 0: mvt1|sonata.type1 to be read as ‘first movement, realised as sonata form type 1’. In a cyclic form, the same label could be specified as 0: sonata, 1: mvt1|sonata form.type1, … (4) where movement level is level 1.\nMaterial content: Despite the standard’s focus on form, we allow for the annotation of material content and its use. For the repetition of materials we propose marking adjacent repetitions with an exclamation mark (!) appended to the relevant token. The number of exclamation marks stands for the number of adjacent repetitions (for instance, 5: bi!! for the second adjacent repetition of a basic idea). An asterisk () appended to any label indicates that the re-occurrence of the relevant function is partial; when converging with a repetition, the asterisk must be annotated before the exclamation mark, e.g., 5: pres!, standing for an immediate, yet abridged, repetition of the presentation function. Distant repeats can be annotated using square brackets indicating the material that is repeated. For instance, 3: 2nd zone, 4: 2nd [1st*] (5) would indicate a partial repeat of 1st-theme material in the secondary-theme zone, characteristic of the so-called monothematic expositions.\nFormal transformation: ‘Form-functional transformation’ (Dahlhaus, 1987; Schmalfeldt, 2011) is ex-pressed in our standard by separating the two functional tokens with greater-than (&gt;) or a less-than (&lt;) symbols, or both (&lt;&gt;); see Figure 4. When the transformation occurs within a single formal level, the three symbols stand for the three possible directions: &gt; for forward transformation (Horton, 2017), &lt; for retrospective transformation (Martin & Vande Moortele, 2014), and &lt;&gt; for bidirectional transformation (Vande Moortele, 2013).\n\n\n\n\ngrafik"
