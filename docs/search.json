One would simply write mvt1|sonata.type1 in the highest component. However, we still reference the integer levels in this guide in order to make the underlying logic clear."

The label component 0: mvt1|sonata.type1 is to be read as ‘first movement, realised as sonata form type 1’, while the component 3: theme|sent tells us that the theme within the 1st zone is realized as a Caplinian sentence.\nTiLiA does have fields for types and function, but for now we recommend writing them into the “label” field in the inspector."

    "text": "Material content and repetition\nDespite the standard’s focus on form, we allow for the annotation of material content and its use. For the repetition of materials we propose marking adjacent repetitions with an exclamation mark (!) appended to the relevant token. The number of exclamation marks stands for the number of adjacent repetitions (for instance, 5: bi!! for the second adjacent repetition of a basic idea). An asterisk appended to any label indicates that the re-occurrence of the relevant function is partial. Distant repeats can be annotated using square brackets indicating the material that is repeated. For instance, 3: 2nd zone, 4: 2nd [1st*] would indicate a partial repeat of 1st-theme material in the secondary-theme zone, characteristic of the so-called monothematic expositions.\nTo avoid ambiguous references, it is possible to assign unique custom names to components that you wish to reference in other places, for example main_theme: theme|sent, means that we call this theme (realised as a sentence) “main_theme”, so if we later write coda [main_theme] it is clear that the coda is repeating that particular theme, not another."

There are also cases where the form can be understood in several different ways, which are either mutually exclusive analytical perspectives, or different formal models being used at the same time. One example of “multidimensional form” could be the main theme zone of a sonata form being structured as a fugue, which invites two different modes of decoding the form at the same time. In both cases, one should open a seperate hierarchy timeline and use it as an addition to add the other layer for the relevant passage."

Segmentation may be based on a variety of factors such as gestalt principles or closing patterns such as cadences. Furthermore, adjacent groups may be disjunct or conjunct to each other (phrase overlap).\nHierarchy: Groups of events can be combined into ever larger groups, thus creating hierarchical relationships between them.\nFunctionality: Groups do not only occur at a certain temporal position within the overall structure; they can also express their form-functionality (i.e., their temporal qualities) through their intrinsic features. They may project a sense of beginning, middle, or end at different hierarchical levels.\nSimilarity: Groups may be repetitions or variations of other groups, or they express a contrast to other groups.\nFormal templates: the ordering of groups as well as the functionalities they express may be such that typical patterns emerge which we refer to as formal templates (e.g., minuet form, rondo form, sonata form, etc.). Formal designs may be the result of the combination of two (or more) formal types (e.g., a theme combining elements from a “sentence” and a “period”); this is known as hybrid form.\n\n\nReinterpretation\nWhat is not form?"

While the part after the symbol indicates what kind of form the piece as a whole has. If the piece is understood to be independent of any larger context, you can use generic names such as “piece”, “track”, “song” etc. The Chopin example was titled in this way, which indicates the interpretation that opus 24 is a rather loosely connected set of individual pieces, rather than a cycle expected to be heard in sequence.\nOther Examples: * mov2|minuet_and_trio - The third movement of a sonata cycle, realized as a minuet with trio. * track04|strophic - The fourth track in a rock album, which happens to be written in a strophic form (no chorus). * exp|continuous - here the analysis only deals with the exposition section of a movement, so that is the head level.

Repetions and variations of immediately preceding timespans on the same level can be indicated using % for larger sections, or the suffixes ! or ' for exact and varied repetition of an idea, respectively.
